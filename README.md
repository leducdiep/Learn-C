# Learn-C
This is the code repository for Learn C Programming

Below are the basic and advanced topics for learning C programming. Ordered from easy to advanced, these topics will help you build a strong foundation and dive deeper into complex aspects of the language.

1. C Basics
* Basic C Syntax: fundamental syntax, data types, operators, and structure of a C program.
* Variables and Data Types: integer, float, character types, and constants.
* Operators: arithmetic, logical, assignment, and comparison operators.
* Control Structures: if, else, switch, for, while, do-while.
* Functions in C: declaring, defining, calling functions, and using parameters.
2. Memory Management and Pointers
* Pointers: concept, declaration, and usage of pointers.
* Pointer Operators: * and & operators.
* Pointers and Arrays: relationship between pointers and arrays, accessing elements via pointers.
* Dynamic Memory Allocation: malloc, calloc, free, realloc.
* Function Pointers: using pointers to point to functions and calling functions via pointers.
3. String Handling
* Character Strings: declaring and using strings.
* String Functions: functions from <string.h> library like strlen, strcpy, strcat, strcmp.
* String Handling with Pointers: manipulating strings through pointers.
4. Data Structures
* Arrays: single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
* Structs: declaring, using, and passing structs to functions.
* Unions: concept and the difference between struct and union.
* Enums: declaring and using enum in C.
5. Advanced C Programming
* File I/O: reading/writing files using functions from <stdio.h> library (fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, fprintf, fscanf).
* Error Handling: using error codes (errno), checking function return values.
* Preprocessor: macros, #define, #include, #ifdef, #ifndef.
* Recursion: declaring and using recursive functions, optimizing recursion.
6. Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures
* Linked Lists: singly linked, doubly linked, circular linked lists.
* Stacks and Queues.
* Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST).
Sorting Algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort.
Searching: linear and binary search.
7. Real-World C Projects
* Simple Calculator: write a basic calculator program.
* Student or Book Management: a basic management program.
* Games: small games like a number guessing game, tic-tac-toe.
* Embedded System Applications: control LED, sensors, and basic I/O devices if interested in embedded programming.

- Expected Output: 
``` 
    Hello, World! 
``` 
2. Simple Arithmetic Calculator
- Objective: Write a program that takes two integers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Requirements:
    * Declare two integer variables.
    * Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and print each result.
- Example Output:
``` Enter first number: 5 
    Enter second number: 3 
    Addition: 8 
    Subtraction: 2 
    Multiplication: 15 
    Division: 1

3. Area of a Circle
- Objective: Write a program to calculate the area of a circle based on a given radius.
- Formula: Area = π * radius * radius (Use 3.14159 for π).
- Requirements:
    * Declare a float variable for the radius.
    * Use * operator to calculate the area.
- Example Output:
``` 
Enter the radius: 5
Area of the circle: 78.53975
```
4. Even or Odd Checker
- Objective: Write a C program to check if an integer is even or odd.
- Requirements:
    * Use the modulus operator % to determine if a number is even or odd.
- Example Output:

Enter a number: 4
4 is even.
```
5. Simple Age Categorizer
- Objective: Write a program that takes an age as input and categorizes it as:
